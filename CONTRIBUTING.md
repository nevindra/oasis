# Contributing to Oasis

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Oasis! This document covers the legal requirements for contributing. For engineering guidelines, coding conventions, and technical standards, see [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## License

Oasis is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE). By submitting a contribution, you agree that your contribution will be licensed under the same terms.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Oasis uses a dual licensing model: AGPL-3.0 for open source use and a separate commercial license for proprietary embedding. To make this possible, all contributors must sign a CLA before their first contribution is merged.

### What the CLA does

By signing the CLA, you:

1. **Confirm** that you have the right to submit the contribution (you wrote it, your employer allows it, etc.)
2. **Assign** copyright ownership of your contribution to the project maintainer. This is a full copyright transfer — the maintainer becomes the sole copyright holder of your contributed code
3. **Acknowledge** that only the project maintainer may relicense, sublicense, or distribute the contribution under terms other than AGPL-3.0

### Why this is necessary

Without a CLA, contributed code can only be distributed under AGPL-3.0. The CLA allows the maintainer to include contributed code in the commercial license offering, which funds continued development of the project.

### How to sign

When you open your first pull request, a CLA bot will ask you to sign. The process takes less than a minute. You only need to sign once — it covers all future contributions.

### What if I don't want to sign?

That's completely fine. You can still:

- Use Oasis under AGPL-3.0
- Fork and modify under AGPL-3.0
- Report issues and suggest features
- Contribute to documentation and examples

## Submitting Contributions

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch
2. Follow the engineering guidelines in [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
3. Ensure all tests pass: `go test ./...`
4. Open a pull request against `master`
5. Sign the CLA if you haven't already

## Questions

If you have questions about the CLA or licensing, open an issue or contact the maintainer.
